## What it does 
### Why Raise Waves
It utilizes **blockchain based technology** to bring about a breakthrough in crowd sourcing apps. It has the ability to revolutionize transparency, trust, and inclusivity in the world of fundraising and support. Here's why:

1. **Transparency Beyond Doubt:** Blockchain's **decentralized nature** ensures that every transaction and action is recorded in **an immutable and transparent manner**. This means that every contributor, fundraiser, and project backer can have confidence in the authenticity of the information. The elimination of intermediaries reduces the chances of fraud and ensures that funds are used as intended.

2. **Trust Through Technology:** With **blockchain**, trust becomes inherent in the system. **Smart contracts can be used to automate processes**, guaranteeing that funds are released only when specific conditions are met. This boosts trust between campaigners and backers, as everyone knows the rules are pre-defined and cannot be tampered with.

3. **Global Inclusivity:** Raise Waves, a **blockchain-based crowdsourcing app** breaks down geographical barriers. Anyone, anywhere in the world, can participate and support projects they resonate with. This inclusivity opens doors for diverse perspectives, cultures, and causes to receive funding that they might not have had access to otherwise.

4. **Reduced Intermediary Costs:** Traditional **crowdfunding platforms** often involve third-party intermediaries that charge fees for their services. Blockchain can significantly reduce these costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries, allowing a larger share of funds to go directly to the projects.

5. **Decentralized Ownership:** Blockchain gives **ownership and control back to the users**. It empowers individuals to drive the success of projects they believe in, without relying on a central authority.

6. **Security and Privacy:** Blockchain's security measures protect sensitive **user data and transactions**. This is crucial for maintaining user privacy and safeguarding financial information.

7. **Easier Cross-Border Transactions:** Cryptocurrencies and blockchain enable **easy cross-border transactions** without the need for currency conversion or high fees, making it easier for backers and fundraisers to connect globally. 

### Features  


### Functionality 

## How to get started
After having forked and cloned our repo- [Raise Waves](https://github.com/vaishnavi-3969/Raise-Waves), run the following commands in the terminal of your system to have you started-
- ```npm install```
- ```cd web3```
- ```npm run deploy``` 
After this step you will need create your API secret key at  Thirdweb and connect with your Metamask account. After having done this you can run the following commands and you local development server will be ready-
- ```cd client```
- ```npm run dev``` 

## How we built it 
We built this revolutionary platform by using following tools and technologies- 
- Thirdweb 
- Hardhat 
- Solidity 
- React 
- Sepolia 
- Metamask

## Challenges we ran into 
We had trouble connecting and staying on the same page throughout the hackathon but we managed to develop and deploy Raise Waves by efficiently dividing task and strategically going about achieving it. We also had problem with coming up with an idea early during the hackathon and everybody in our team was new to **Web3 Development** but we managed to learn from YouTube tutorials, documentations and community forums online. By our efforts we were able to present to you **MVP** of our idea- **Raise Waves**. Moreover on technical front we also had trouble getting test coins from **Goerli** so had to use **Sepolia** instead to get test coins. In addition to this some of us also had trouble using **Hardhat** and **Thirdweb** efficiently but we as whole were able to help each other and come up with good solutions online.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
Since, today we have become **Dappsters** officially, we are proud of taking our very first step into the world of Web3 Development and Blockchain. We had a great time coding, and of course **dapping**, this weekend. It was a great weekend, diving into web3, connecting with amazing folks from the MLH community, being able to come up with our novel idea- **Raise Waves** and building our **first glimpse** and hence the **MVP of Raise Waves**. Moreover, we are also proud of being optimistic and confident, during the entire hackathon, in the face of adversities we faced.

## What we learned 
We learnt how to work with **Hardhat and Thirdweb**, and got a rough **idea of flow web3 development cycle**, also about the rough file structure of any **Web3 project** and how the frontend basically remains the same in Web3 Development. In addition to this we learnt how to integrate **smart contracts** with our **interactive frontend** and how to deploy smart contract with ease using Thirdweb and Hardhat. Moreover, we also enjoyed getting familiar with **Flow** and **Circle**, though we couldn't go forward with our initial plan of using Flow in our project because of lack of time and unfamiliarity. In addition to these technical skills, we learnt to manage time, work strategically, create viable backups and interact with various tech enthusiast on various community forums.
